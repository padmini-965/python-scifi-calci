A scientific calculator application built in Python using the Tkinter GUI framework and math module. Supports both basic arithmetic and advanced mathematical operations via conditional logic.

FEATURES :

# Basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

# Scientific functions: sin, cos, tan, logarithms, exponentiation, square root, power, factorial

# GUI: intuitive button layout with input display using Tkinter

# Conditional logic: handles errors like invalid expressions and divides by zero using try/except

# Extensible: modular button definitions make it easy to add more functions

CLONE THE REPOSITORY:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scientific-calculator.git

‚òëÔ∏è Usage:

* Click buttons to build your expression.
* Use = to evaluate and display the result.
* Use C to clear the entry.
* The app uses eval() with error-handling via try/except to safely compute user input.

üß© How It Works:

# Input Building: Each button press appends text to the entry widget.
# Error Handling: Invalid math or syntax triggers exception; entry clears and shows ‚ÄúError‚Äù.
# Clear Function: The C button resets the display to empty.
